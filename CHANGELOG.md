## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-19

Documentation and packaging release; no functional provider changes. 0.3.1 fixed the database resource after a customer report; this completes the same sweep across every other resource, data source and guide.

### Fixed

- **Three more examples were not applyable.** `cache` and `cache-redis` set the read-only `cpu_cores`/`memory_size_mb` (and `cache-redis` omitted the now-required `resource_profile`); `vps-firewall` still used `rules { }` blocks after `rules` became a list attribute, plus the read-only VPS `cpu_cores`/`memory_size_gb`/`storage_size_gb`. All 11 examples now pass `terraform validate`; previously 3 failed with 12 errors between them.
- **`cache-redis` pinned Redis 7.2, which is not an offered version** (8.4, 8.0 and 7.4 are). This class of error is invisible to `terraform validate` because it is enforced server-side. Every version, image id, profile slug and datacenter literal across all examples was audited against the platform config; the rest were correct.
- **`docs/index.md` — the provider's Terraform Registry landing page — showed pre-0.3.0 HCL throughout**, including read-only VPS/cache/database attributes and `rules { }` firewall blocks. Same for `README.md` and the guides.
- Every resource and data source page realigned with the schema: read-only attributes no longer presented as settable, required arguments no longer marked optional, removed attributes deleted, timeout defaults corrected against the code, and import examples corrected to the right ID type (UUID vs integer).
- Registry protocol metadata: `terraform-registry-manifest.json` is now published as a release asset. Without it the registry advertises protocol 5.0 for every published version, while `providerserver.Serve` (terraform-plugin-framework v1.17) actually speaks 6.0.

### Added

- Documentation for the six previously undocumented resources: `parameter_group`, `database_replica`, `cache_snapshot`, `database_snapshot`, `static_site`, `static_site_domain`.
- Documentation for the four previously undocumented data sources: `parameter_groups`, `cache_snapshots`, `database_snapshots`, `static_sites`.
- Cache and database pages now carry a plan-slug table mapping each slug to its dashboard display name (`micro`=DD Puiu, `small`=DD Uzlina, `medium`=DD Matita, `large`=DD Sinoe). Confusing the slug with the display name is what prompted the original report.

### Known upstream issues

- Firewall rule `order` and `name` are still not honoured by the API, and this is now documented on the firewall page and in the example. `FirewallManagementController::store()` reads `$ruleData['priority']` while the request validates neither `order` nor `priority`, so rules are always auto-numbered in submission sequence; `FirewallResource` serializes a non-existent `priority` column and never returns `order`, and reads rule `name` from a column that does not exist. Setting either attribute surfaces "inconsistent result after apply". A platform-side fix is tracked separately.

### Verification

All 113 HCL blocks across the documentation were extracted and validated against the provider schema (111 complete configurations valid; 2 are intentional `# ... existing config ...` fragments). Every documented attribute was cross-checked against `terraform providers schema -json` — no page documents an attribute the provider does not have.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- **`danubedata_database` examples were not applyable.** The 0.3.0 schema realignment made `cpu_cores`/`memory_size_mb` read-only and `resource_profile` required, but only `examples/complete` was updated to match. `examples/database` failed with "Invalid Configuration for Read-Only Attribute" and `examples/database-mysql` additionally failed with "Missing required argument". Both now validate.
- **`docs/resources/database.md` documented a schema that no longer exists.** It listed `cpu_cores`/`memory_size_mb` as settable arguments, marked `resource_profile` optional when it is required, showed a `db-medium` profile value that has never been valid, and gave 20m create/update timeout defaults where the code uses 30m. The import example used an integer ID; database instance IDs are UUIDs.

### Changed

- `resource_profile` schema description now enumerates the valid slugs (`micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`) with their dashboard display names (DD Puiu, DD Uzlina, DD Matita, DD Sinoe). It previously listed only "small, medium, large", omitting `micro` entirely — the slug-vs-display-name gap was a reported source of user confusion, including customers selecting a profile roughly 4x their intended spend.
- `monthly_cost` schema description corrected from "dollars" to "euros".
- `docs/resources/database.md` now documents the `database_name` charset restriction (letters, numbers, underscores; no hyphens, unlike the instance `name`), a common first-apply failure.
- `examples/database-mysql` version constraint bumped from `~> 0.1` to `~> 0.3`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed — API contract drift (2026-07 audit against the live API)

Unit-test fixtures were rewritten to encode the current API contract, so this class of drift now fails CI instead of passing against stale mocks.

#### Breaking decode bugs (resources were non-functional against production)
- Snapshot IDs (VPS, cache, database) are integers in API responses; the client decoded them as strings and failed on every create/list/get. All snapshot waiters also polled for status `completed` — the API's terminal status is `ready` — and now fail fast on the real failure statuses (`failed`, `create_failed`/`restore_failed`) instead of hanging until timeout.
- `danubedata_vps.ssh_key_id` is numeric in responses; decoding it as a string broke every read of an SSH-key-authenticated VPS.
- Static site and static site domain IDs are UUIDs; the client decoded them as integers, breaking all reads. Domain response fields realigned: `verification_status`/`tls_status`/`deployment_status`/`is_primary`/`dns_instructions` (nested object) replace the removed `status`/`type`/`verification_record`.
- Storage bucket `tags` is a string array, not a map; buckets with tags were unreadable.

#### Serverless — field vocabulary realigned with the current API
- `deployment_type` values are now `docker_image`/`git_repository`/`zip_upload`.
- Renamed attributes: `image_url`→`image` (+ new `image_tag`, default `latest`), `git_repository`→`repository_url`, `git_branch`→`repository_branch`, `min_instances`→`min_scale`, `max_instances`→`max_scale`. Added `source_type`, `git_auth_type`, `git_credentials` (sensitive) for git deployments.
- `repository_url` no longer forces replacement (the API supports in-place edits).

#### Firewalls — realigned with the 2025-10 firewall model
- Rule `action` is `allow`/`deny` (was `accept`/`drop`); rule ordering attribute is `order` (was `priority`); protocols `gre`/`esp` added.
- Removed `default_action` and `is_default` (no longer exist in the API; they caused "inconsistent result after apply" on every create).
- Rule changes are now sent on update (previously silently dropped).

#### Silent no-ops and perpetual diffs
- `danubedata_vps`: `cpu_cores`/`memory_size_gb`/`storage_size_gb` are Computed (derived from `resource_profile`; the API never accepted them), password changes no longer pretend to update in place, and `auth_method`/`ssh_key_id`/`custom_cloud_init`/`network_stack`/`password` now correctly force replacement. `private_ip` is read from `connection_info`. Datacenter validator matches the API (`fsn1` only).
- `danubedata_cache`: `memory_size_mb`/`cpu_cores` are Computed; name validator matches the API (2–63 chars, lowercase DNS-safe); hardcoded `resource_profile` list removed (plans are dynamic).
- `danubedata_database`: name length matches the API (2–63); hardcoded `resource_profile` list removed; datacenter `ash` removed (not offered for databases).
- `parameter_group_id` (cache and database) is preserved in state instead of being nulled on every read (the API does not echo it).
- `danubedata_static_site`: removed `team_id`/`output_directory`/`current_deployment_id` (not part of the API contract; `team_id` forced replacement on every refresh). Added `plan` (defaults to `free`).
- Cache/database engine mapping now prefers the API's `provider.type` over the display name; the caches data source no longer reports a `datacenter` the API never returns.

### Added
- `danubedata_database.storage_size_gb` is now configurable (Optional+Computed): grow-only storage resize via update, with create-then-resize when the configured value exceeds the plan minimum at create time. Shrinking is rejected by the API.

### Known upstream issues
- Firewall rule `order` and rule `name` are accepted but not persisted/echoed by the API, and rule updates are not yet applied server-side; setting them surfaces "inconsistent result after apply" until the platform fix ships.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

#### Resources
- `danubedata_parameter_group` - Manage cache, database, and queue parameter groups with custom parameters and locked keys.
- `danubedata_database_replica` - Manage read replicas for database instances (use `count`/`for_each` + `depends_on` to serialize creation).
- `danubedata_cache_snapshot` - Manage snapshots of cache instances.
- `danubedata_database_snapshot` - Manage snapshots of database instances.
- `danubedata_static_site` - Manage static sites (Pages). Build/deploy triggers remain a CLI/CI concern.
- `danubedata_static_site_domain` - Attach custom domains to static sites with automatic verification trigger.

#### Data Sources
- `danubedata_parameter_groups` - List parameter groups, filterable by type and provider.
- `danubedata_cache_snapshots` - List cache snapshots.
- `danubedata_database_snapshots` - List database snapshots.
- `danubedata_static_sites` - List static sites for a team.

#### Attributes
- `danubedata_cache.password` - Sensitive computed attribute exposing the cache password (from `GET /cache/{id}/connection-info`).
- `danubedata_cache.connection_info` - Sensitive computed attribute exposing the cache connection URI.
- `danubedata_cache.dns_enabled` - Optional bool for toggling public DNS via declarative state. Out-of-band DNS changes are not detected until re-applied (API limitation).
- `danubedata_database.password` - Sensitive computed attribute exposing the root password.
- `danubedata_database.connection_info` - Sensitive computed attribute exposing the database connection URI.
- `danubedata_database.dns_enabled` - Optional bool for toggling public DNS (same limitation as cache).
- `danubedata_vps.password` - Now `Optional + Computed`: always populated after provisioning from `GET /vps/{id}/password`.

### Design decisions
- **Not added to the provider** (left to CLI/CI by design):
  - Lifecycle actions: `vps start|stop|reboot|reinstall`, `cache start|stop`, `database start|stop`.
  - Snapshot restore/clone (one-shot recovery operations).
  - Serverless deploy triggers (CI/CD concern).
  - Metrics/status/usage endpoints (read-only telemetry).
  - Access key rotation (handled via `terraform taint`).
